What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when you initialize a repository, you can creating commits and start tracking your file changes in that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
From my point of view, staging area is like a distribution center which collect files in working directory which need to be delivered to repository. So you only have to deliver a batch of good once instead of several times.
